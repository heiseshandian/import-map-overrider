### üìã Usage

#### Precise URL Redirection (Only Mode)
```
Rule Name: my-redirect-rule
Old URL: https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21 (Required)
New URL: https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash@4.17.21
```

### üîÑ Migration Guide

If you previously used package name mapping mode, you need to:
1. Convert package names to specific URLs
2. Fill in the complete source URL in the "Old URL" field
3. Fill in the target URL in the "New URL" field

### üéØ Use Cases

Precise redirection is suitable for scenarios where you need to redirect specific URLs to another URL, such as:
- Fixing bugs in specific versions
- Using local development versions
- Switching to faster CDNs
- Solving compatibility issues with specific URLs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

- After adding or modifying override rules, you must **refresh the page** for Service Worker interception rules to take effect
- All rules are now exact matches
- The "Old URL" field cannot be empty
